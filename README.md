# Preprocessing-absenteeism-data
Data Preprocessing : a group of operations that will convert the raw-data into a format that is easier to understand and hence, useful for further processing and analysis.
First, we will preprocess the data. We devote a significant amount of time to this step as it is a crucial part of every analytical task.
We will start working on the ‘Absenteeism_data.csv’ file and take it to a usable state in a machine learning algorithm.
